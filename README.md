# music-genre-classification


The goal of this project is to use traditional Machine Learning algorithms and Artificial Neural Networks that can learn to classify an input audio signal(music file) into one of 10 music genres. This dataset used for training the model was used for the well-known paper in genre classification “Musical genre classification of audio signals” by G. Tzanetakis and P. Cook in IEEE Transactions on Audio and Speech Processing 2002.

The dataset consists of 1000 audio tracks each 30 seconds long. It contains 10 genres, each represented by 100 tracks. The tracks are all 22050 Hz monophonic 16-bit audio files in .wav format.

The dataset can be downloaded from here.

The 10 music genres are :

 - Blues
 - Classical
 - Country
 - Disco
 - Hiphop
 - Jazz
 - Metal
 - Pop
 - Reggae
 - Rock
In the dataset, each genre consists of 100 songs, making a total of 1000 songs.
